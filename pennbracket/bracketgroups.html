<h2 id="1"> Assembly of International Students </h2>
<br>
<img src="http://dpwebadmin.github.io/Photos/AIS%20Photo.jpg" width="480">
<p >Making waves across campus, the Assembly of International Students isn't just campaigning for international issues, we're here to help everyone! Do you like Indian food? Vote for us so that we can have more events with spicy food! Want to go to Turkey on your next Spring Break trip? Vote for us and come meet our members from Turkey! They'll show you it's a true gem of the Mediterranean. And vote for us, because, after all, America is a nation of immigrants - we're all international! </p>
<br>

<h2 id="2"> Asian Pacific Student Coalition</h2>

<br>
<img src="http://dpwebadmin.github.io/Photos/APSC%20Photo.png" width="480">
<p >
We're gonna get fined, because APSC balls so hard. When we're not busy fighting for the AsianÂ­Pacific Islander population at Penn, we occasionally bring in pretty cool people like Aziz Ansari and Wong Fu Productions. If you care about Asian issues, Asian culture,
Asian food, and/or Asian people, vote for APSC.</p>
<h2 id="3"> Black Wharton Undergraduate Association </h2>
<br><center>
<img src="http://dpwebadmin.github.io/Photos/Black%20Wharton%20Undergraduate%20Association%20Photo.png" height="400"></center>
<p >
	Established in 1985, Black Wharton's been in the business of "killing the game" for 30 years. In fact, BWUA members have gone on to serve as higher-uppers in companies ranging from Morgan Stanley to Bad Boy Entertainment. When we're not Diddy-bopping in boardrooms, we're sculpting our members into leaders of tomorrow; whether it be at our monthly GBMs, or our award-winning HEMM Conference. Our supporters are some of the most influential move-makers on campus, so don't be surprised if you see Dean Garrett donning a BWUA shirt down Locust. There's no doubt that we'll win. Don't believe us? Just watch. 
</p>
<h2 id="4"> Bloomers </h2>
<br>
<img src="http://dpwebadmin.github.io/Photos/Bloomers%20Photo.jpg" width="480">
<p >

Who says women aren't funny? Bloomers is the nation's first collegiate all-female musical and sketch comedy troupe. We dance, we sing, we act, but mostly we make you laugh. We wear our bloomers proudly, and with our sold-out shows, rocking Fling sets, and social media prowess (#bloomersweek), there's no doubt that we have what it takes to win this. VOTE FOR BLOOMERS!
</p>
<h2 id ="5"> Counterparts </h2>
<br>
<center><img src="http://dpwebadmin.github.io/Photos/Counterparts%20Photo.jpg" height="400"></center>

<p>Counterparts, founded in 1981, is Penn's premier co-ed jazz and pop a cappella group. They are sexy when your eyes are closed, presentable when they're open, and soulful all the time. The group has been graced by some of the best voices to pass through Penn. Former members include John Legend and some girl named Sheetal. Their sultry, sassy sound is sure to impress. #CPforGlory</p>

<h2 id="6"> College Republicans</h2>
<br>
<center><img src="http://media.pennlive.com/opinion/photo/republican-elephant-art-72649f222b0b5f75.jpg
" height="400"></center>

<p>

Just like Matthew McConaughey, we, the College Republicans, have been longtime fans of Lincoln. From our foundation in the feminist movement via our unrivaled backing of Betsy Ross's fabulous work to our "readiness" for Hillary Clinton's candidacy, we are clearly loved by most people on this campus - especially Wharton students' future selves. Based on the overwhelming number of Republicans at Penn, we are sure to win with merely the support of many times our constituency. Please vote* for us! *Valid I.D. required, of course.
</p>
<h2 id="7"> International Affairs Association </h2>
<br>
<center><img src="http://dpwebadmin.github.io/Photos/IAA%20Photo.jpg" height="350"></center>
<p>

One of the largest most versatile clubs on campus? Here we are. The IAA is gonna sweep this, with 8 branches doing everything from speaker events, to service-driven activities, social events, an IR magazine, and of course competing and running in Model UN conferences across the world.Voting for us is like voting for Penn: Work hard play hard? That's what we're all about.
</p>

<h2 id="8"> Government and Politics Association </h2>
<br>
<img src="http://dpwebadmin.github.io/Photos/Government%20and%20Politics%20Association%20Photo.jpg" width="480">
<p>

We love dominating campus politics more than a shark loves blood at the Government & Politics Association, Penn's largest political group, campaigning's in our blood. Like Congress, we love sitting and talking about big problems. But unlike Congress, we do stuff about them. We know people don?t always turn out to vote, but we think you will in this challenge. Why? Because deep down, everyone at Penn loves their GPA.
</p>

<h2 id="9">Mask and Wig</h2><br>
<img src="http://dpwebadmin.github.io/Photos/Mask%20and%20Wig%20Photo.jpg" width="480">

<p>

We are the Mask and Wig Club, one of the oldest collegiate musical comedy troupes. Yeah, its a bit of a mouthful, but we're here to help you laugh it out. We've been putting on shows for 127 years, so we definitely know what we're doing. Whether you've flung with our band in the quad, brought a special someone to our Clubhouse downtown, or "laughed until you cried? while watching our skits, we've always been by your side. Stand by our side this March because a vote for Mask and Wig is a vote for laughter and good cheer.
</p>

<h2 id="10">Lambda Alliance</h2>
<br><center>
<img src="http://dpwebadmin.github.io/Photos/Lambda%20Alliance%20Photo.png" height="200"></center>

<p>
When you think about the LGBTQ+ community at Penn and when you think about influential activism, one name comes to mind: Lambda. This organization does not play around. With ten years worth of working with students and administration to make queer life at Penn better, Lambda has the skill set to go all the way. Now, watch us prove it throughout the month of March!
</p>

<h2 id="11">Latin@ Coalition</h2>
<br>
<center>	 
<img src="http://dpwebadmin.github.io/Photos/Latin%40%20Coalition%20Photo.png" width="200"></center>

<p>
From the sensuous moves of Onda Latina to meetings with Amy Gutmann, the LC works hard to represent the Latin@ community at Penn. With a unified voice spanning from Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic, among others, the Latin@ Coalition is a force to be reckoned with. Vote Latin@ Coalition!
</p>


<h2 id="12">MERT</h2>
<br>
<img src="http://dpwebadmin.github.io/Photos/MERT%20Photo.jpg" width="480">

<p>

Donning our notorious red polos, MERT's team of over 50 Pennsylvania certified EMTs is always there to help Penn's campus. We don't hesitate to save lives; you shouldn't hesitate to vote for us as your favorite student group at Penn.
</p><h2 id="13">MUSE</h2>
<img src="http://dpwebadmin.github.io/Photos/MUSE%20Photo.png" width="480">

<p>

MUSE, what does it stand for? What do we stand for? How can I string more questions together? Am I doing a good job? That's a beautiful question. A question I hope to answer. One we will explore together through the mutual bond that is Marketing. A mutual bond shared between 5 glasses of whiskey, 2 packs of cigarettes, and 3 extra-marital affairs before lunch. This is because networking, reaching out, synergies, touching base, pivoting, circling back, boiling the frog, leveraging, strategery, and buzz-words? looking forward to hearing back from you. Brought to you by MUSE, a Family Company. 
</p>

<h2 id="14">Nominations and Elections Committee</h2>
<br><center>
<img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7604/16168785254_4ee2644568_m.jpg" height="200"></center>
<p>

Last year we were involved in the most House of Cards-esque event at Penn.  This bracket is basically an election and elections are what we do.  The Nominations & Elections Committee is already the best-looking branch of Penn Stud Gov. We're business sexy.  We choose who gets to hang out with Amy Gutmann on University Council.  We make sure PSG elections run fairly, and if they don't, we hold hearings like the one you watched last year.  We're the judicial branch of PSG.  We'd tap that and you should too.
</p>

<h2 id="15">Penn Band</h2>
<br>
<img src="http://dpwebadmin.github.io/Photos/Penn%20Band%20Photo.jpg" width="480">
<p>

Introducing, the Huge, the Enormous, the Well-Endowed, Undefeated, Ivy-League Champion, University of Pennsylvania Oxymoronic Fighting Quaker Marching Band. This multi-talented group has more spirit than you can shake a spirit stick at, has been waking up the quad since 1897, and loved Penn Women's Basketball before it was cool.  Remember it's always better to play with a group than play with yourself! 
</p>

<h2 id="16">Penn Democrats</h2>
<br>
<img src="http://dpwebadmin.github.io/Photos/Penn%20Dems%20Photo.jpg" width="480">
<p>

Penn Democrats is a political organization whose mission is to promote progressive political values on and off campus, through dialogue and action. Penn Democrats is a major campus hub for stimulating political discourse. We work closely with Democratic campaigns at all levels to support the election of progressive candidates to public office. Penn Democrats participates in political campaigns, conducts voter registration drives, seeks to stimulate discussion through issue-based activism, and hosts events with politicians such as Bill Clinton. While we normally implore you to vote for Democratic candidates, we humbly ask you to vote for us in this bracket!  
</p>

<h2 id="17">Penn Dhamaka</h2>
<br>
<img src="http://dpwebadmin.github.io/Photos/Penn%20Dhamaka%20Photo.jpg" width="350">
<p>
Penn Dhamaka is Penn's premier all-male dance troupe. We specialize in South Asian fusion dance, including styles ranging from dynamic Bollywood and bhangra to powerful hip-hop and step. Not only do we hold an annual show and year-round performances in Philadelphia, but we also perform throughout the greater East Coast. So, why do we deserve your vote? We're a brotherhood that uses artistry and finesse to entertain you, while spreading South Asian culture. Watch us perform or watch our videos, and you're bound to catch the fervor! A vote for us will definitely put a smile on your face. 
</p>


<h2 id="18">Penn Quidditch</h2>
<br>
<center><img src="http://dpwebadmin.github.io/Photos/Penn%20Quidditch%20Photo.jpg" height="400"></center>
<p>

You know who we are, even if you don't know what we are. We're the Penn Pygmy Puffs, Penn's muggle quidditch team, and we're tougher than your stereotypical nerds. Playing a coed cross between dodgeball, basketball, and rugby, we have to be! Vote for us, because what would Saturday be without your weekly dose of randos doing something strange on Highrise Field? We may be unusual, but the only folks who'd run around with brooms between their legs are ones with swag to spare, right?
</p>

<h2 id="19">PennSori</h2>
<img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7592/16168408114_bb055870a9_n.jpg" width="480">
<p>

Sori, we're not sorry... that we are gonna win this thing! As Penn's premier Korean-American A Cappella group, we've been keeping the KPOP scene alive in Philly for 10 years. From taking first place at the East Coast Korean American Students Conference (KASCON) talent competition twice, to singing at a Phillies game, to performing for the President and First Lady of the United States, PennSori represents all over the country! Our alums also teach in CA, make bank in HK, and start up big names in Seoul. Support PennSori as we keep on singing around the world!
</p>

<h2 id="20">Penn Vegan Society</h2>
<br>
<img src="http://dpwebadmin.github.io/Photos/Penn%20Vegan%20Society%20Photo.jpg" width="480">

<p>

The Penn Vegan Society is ready to take this tournament by storm. We've got the plant-based endurance for the long haul. And with the wide breadth that we cover in health, the environment, and ethics, a vote for us is basically a vote for the future.
</p>

<h2 id="21">Penn Taiwanese Society</h2> <br>
<img src="http://dpwebadmin.github.io/Photos/Penn%20Taiwanese%20Society%20Photo.jpg" width="480">
<p>

A new challenger has emerged! A vote for PTS in the Penn bracket means several things. Programming to blow your mind away? Check! Awesome-sauce people to be with? Super check! Awesome free food events? We got you covered! There's really no reason not to vote for one of the greatest communities on Penn's campus. On top of that, we're always here to entertain, help out, and just chill. PTS? More like PT-Yassss.
</p>


<h2 id="22">PennYo</h2><br>
<center>
<img src="http://dpwebadmin.github.io/Photos/PennYo%20Photo.jpg" height="350"></center>
<p>

Thirteen years in existence. Thirteen fabulous members. One united goal.
As Penn's Premier Chinese A Cappella group, PennYo has consistently strived to introduce the richness and diversity of Chinese pop music to the Penn community. While our name is a play on the Chinese phrase for "friend" ("Peng You"), we treat each other like a family bonded together by our love for singing and Chinese music. Family always has each other's backs, and our PennYo family certainly won't go down in this competition without a fight. To our competitors: watch YO backs, because the YOs are coming for you.
</p><h2 id="23">Punch Bowl</h2> <br>
<img src="http://dpwebadmin.github.io/Photos/Punch%20Bowl%20Photo.jpg" width="480">
<p>

The Punch Bowl was founded in 1899 by disenchanted rich Ivy
Leaguers who established a tradition of excellence and scathing
social satire we maintain to this day, though sadly the amount of
yacht owners on staff has declined steadily since our founding.
At more than a century old, the Punch Bowl has joked about
everything from the DP and the Vietnam war, to Wharton and your
mom. We hope you like the magazine and our website, and that youâll
laugh, cry, or be enlightened. Okay, maybe just laugh or cry.
</p>
<h2 id="30">Student Activities Council</h2>
<br>
<img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/v/t1.0-9/10636169_688154217939339_4655120470494068512_n.jpg?oh=3cd036700a264d97d1306d0f0bf1618f&oe=55753A01&__gda__=1434996701_cd404d64074477f4fcc5f3754ee941e8" width="480">
<p>
The big SAC (or Student Activities Council, to the uninitiated) is the team you want to put your money on, because we've probably given any group you've been in money to fund your events (but not your BYOs!). We have the power of the purse behind us, which on this campus can mean a pretty pricey Louis Vuitton bag, so there's no stopping us. Voting for us is like the end of the former moratorium - it's better for everyone.
</p>

<h2 id="24">Shabbatones</h2>
<br>
<img src="http://dpwebadmin.github.io/Photos/Shabbatones%20Photo.jpg" width="480">
<p>

The premier (only??) Jewish a cappella group at Penn, in case you hadn't heard. Touting a set list ripe with Hebrew and English hits, the Shabbatones snagged an invite to the hypest party this side of Chancellor: The White House Hanukkah Party. They took their sweet sound and brought it all the way to D.C., performing privately for the President and the First Lady. Evidently Michelle and Barack were dying to audition, complementing them on their dank swagger and strong yarmulke game. Catch them in the studio working on their seventh album (spoiler alert: its fire).
</p><h2 id="25">Strictly Funk</h2><br>
<img src="http://dpwebadmin.github.io/Photos/Strictly%20Funk%20Photo.JPG" width="480">
<p>

This is serious.
As one of Penn's well established dance companies, we have been fusing delicate contemporary and hard hitting hip-hop since 1997. We are more than just a group of dancers, our company is a family first, made up of some of the most compassionate and unique individuals on campus. No matter where you see us perform, by the end of the show you will want to Funk with us. Why do we deserve to win Penn bracket? Well? we have a badass attitude and we are always in the mood for some competition.
</p>

<h2 id="26">Undergraduate Assembly</h2><br>
<img src="http://dpwebadmin.github.io/Photos/UA%20Photo.jpg" width="480">
<p>

As the only elected branch of Penn Student Government that represents the *entire* student body, the UA is ready to bring it for March Madness. Think we're just the airport shuttles club? Well, think again. This past year we've spent hundreds of hours working on over 90 projects that touch on student life, academic affairs, social justice and dining, sustainability and facilities to better your experience at Penn. You can thank us for allocating over $2.1 million that goes towards Fling, MERT and student group funding (yep, yours too). You know what you need to do - Vote for the UA!  
</p>

<h2 id="27">United Minorities Council</h2><br>
<img src="http://dpwebadmin.github.io/Photos/UMC%20Photo.jpg" width="480">
<p>
The United Minorities Council has been the voice for minority groups on Penn's campus for over 30 years. We're all about promoting interculturalism and social justice here at Penn. Our goal is to unify student groups while showcasing diversity through events like the Celebration of Cultures and Unity Month. We would not be here today without the advocacy of minority students, which is why we continue to advocate for you. 
</p>


<h2 id="28">UMOJA</h2>
<br>
<img src="http://dpwebadmin.github.io/Photos/UMOJA%20Photo.jpg" height="300">
<p>

If you're reading this it's too late. Why? Because all UMOJA does is win, win, win no matter what. Aside from winning, our goal is to serve as the umbrella organization for black student groups on campus and as the direct link to administration for our constituents. In other words, we're pretty legit. So, this year when it's time to vote there's only one choice for the Penn Bracket and that's us. If you don't know, now you know.
</p>
<h2 id="29">Wharton Women</h2>
<br>
<img src="http://dpwebadmin.github.io/Photos/WW%20Photo.jpg" width="480">
<p>Who run the world? Girls. Beyonce said it best herself. So follow Queen Bey's advice and vote for the club that empowers women in business, Wharton Women! With past Wharton Women speakers such Bethenny Frankel, Forrest Gump film producer Wendy Finerman, and the CMO of McDonald's, Deborah Wahl, there is no better team in the game.  Get ready, because we not only Dress for Success and Stride in Higher in Heels, We Win.</p>
