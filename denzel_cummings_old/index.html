     <p>Incoming freshmen take note — College senior Ariel Koren has a theory for you.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>To cancel out the bad luck from landing on the Compass at 37th and Locust streets before your midterms, do a handstand.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>This is just the kind of quirky and lighthearted tradition to expect from Ariel, but it is still near the bottom of the long list of ideas that she's come up with and worked to make stick while at Penn.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>From the school's annual Holi celebration to Active Cross&#45;Cultural Training in Our Neighborhoods, an after&#45;school foreign language program Koren founded, the Class of 2015 president has made several lasting changes on campus.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>At first, Ariel said, the administration was completely against the idea of Holi in the form it takes today — throwing chalky colored powder into the air on College Green — due to the mess it leaves behind and other organizational issues. “I just went back and pushed it again. I think that’s been a very common theme for my experience on Class Board: Push, push as far as you can, and think big. Go all out,” she said.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Penn Holi eventually became a large, messy and color&#45;filled event in 2013 thanks to a collaboration between the Hindu Student Council &amp; Young Jains of America and the Class Boards.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Pulling the event together in just a few weeks that first year, organizers expected some several hundred people, but instead drew a crowd of more than a thousand, Ariel remembered.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Ariel called Holi the perfect collaboration between the Class Board, HSC &amp; YJA and Penn Traditions. “It’s the ultimate way to bring people together in celebration of diversity and to create this sense of community,” she said.</p>
