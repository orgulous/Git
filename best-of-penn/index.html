											<p>BEPP250 prefers to fuck you slowly to the Mortal Kombat theme song on loop for 10 hours on YouTube. But before you camp out in a GSR with the door cracked slightly open to prevent the pooling of your tears, remember that somewhere on campus there is another person like you, and another bed like yours. Spending a weekend night holed up in Huntsman is already depressing enough. Dragging yourself back to your room to and a sock on the doorknob fucks you over minus the actual fucking. All of a sudden you're nothing but a wanderer of the night, left out in the cold while your roommate makes use of your R. Kelly Spotify playlist, which is so untouched it has pixelated dust bunnies on it.
											<br>
											Cheer up and go grab yourself some late-night Axe Body Spray from  e Fresh Grocer, because it's time to make a new friend. This will not be another night spent playing Yu-Gi-Oh! against yourself in a dark Van Pelt corner. Go to your roommate's lover's room, knock on the door and brace yourself for some good ol' human interaction. Maybe you'll meet your new best friend. Or, better yet, a lover. Remember on How I Met Your Mother when Ted was in  e Mother's apartment like four seasons before they ever met? (Ed. note: If this is a spoiler for you, forget going to their room and get on Net ix, ASAP.)  is is you cutting corners. Penn has 10,000 undergrads and a huge chunk of that population is single and ripe for picking. What if the roommate is that slender blonde with the piercing blue eyes who you catch checking you out in your Spanish class? What if the roommate is the person from your freshman hall you had way too much sexual tension with, swiped right on Tinder "by accident," matched and laughed it o as a joke even though you would totally do it (read: them)? You miss 100% of the shots you don't aimlessly barge into at 2am.

Verified yes, it was. Well, listen the fuck up because the Rhythm Room is the formal hotspot you never knew you needed. The illustrious Elizabeth Barrett Browning once wrote of the Rhythm Room: <i>How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. I love thee more than Copa, Tap or Smokes' on Tuesday night. Empty theaters my date and I will breach, when we want to get out of sight. For the end of being sober, you're an ideal place. I love thee to the level Oz groupies love The HeyDaze. If you asked me if I liked thee to feel ironic, you'd only be half right. I love thee freely, as drinks are cheap in price.</i> I might've paraphrased that. Either way, get yourself to the Rhythm Room. Street's having our formal there-if you're lucky enough to snag yourself an invite. P.S. If you decide we suck, you can always Irish exit with your mojito in hand, courtesyof their convenient to-go cups.

											<p>At Street we pride ourselves on being classy.  at is, being with the Wharton MBA Class of 2016. And the best way to bask in the elegance of said class is LinkedIn, the Belvedere of social networks. True, the professional bene ts of LinkedIn are debatable, but the site's capacity for networking with a well-endowed Wharton Executive Education hottie is unmatched. Here's how to take your romance out of the boardroom and into the bedroom:
											<br>
											<ol>
												<li>Go to LinkedIn.com</li>
												<li>Advanced search: The Wharton School</li>
												<li>Select Industry: Finance</li>
												<li>Company: Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, McKinsey (whichever firm fits your fancy)</li>
												<li>Optional: Fortune level (50 = old ass dudes, if you're tryna get it now. 1000 = young dudes who you can debatably fuck without Viagra).</li>
											</ol>
											<br>
											Now, find the most connected MBA and send him/her an InMail-ask about "networking opportunities." Make sure you mention your love of finace and the undeveloped market that is your body. Once Mr. Hubby responds, ask him to connect. From there you can endorse his skills in proprietary trading.  Then he can endorse your skills in the sheets (not talking about Excel here).

											<p>Everyone knows that there are certain places on campus that are perfect for SABS-ing, like the outside deck of Frontera or an elevated surface at Rumor. But sometimes you wake up in the morning in an ugly guy's bed, with your eyebrows not at all on fleek, and you really just need to avoid people.  What you need is a good anti-SABS location. What you need is a trip to Penne Restaurant and Wine Bar.
											<br>
											You know Penne-it's that vaguely Italian restaurant at 36th and Walnut that you've never stepped foot inside.  Maybe your parents have gone there for a drink to pregame  your horrible Pan-Asian tap dance show they have to attend  because they literally conceived you. But it'll be a cold day in hell before you see a Penn student there.
											<br>
											That's what makes it the perfect place to anti-SABS. You step into Penne, order a large glass of their house red and a  plate of fettuccine alfredo, and revel in your social irrelevance. There's no way you'll run into your big or that bro in Kappa Sig that would be cute if he weren't so bitey when you hooked up <i>(Ed. note: please stop biting my lips-they're not chew toys).</i> It's just you and your pasta, the way it should be.

											<p>You stumble home from your late night, only to find yourself in desperate need of a throw up location. Trashcans are too widely dispersed, and any public bathrooms still open (read: Allegro) put you at the risk of running into your hookup from 20 minutes ago. Sure, you could vomit on the side of the road or into some bushes, but you'd like to maintain at least a little dignity while you dry heave.
											<br>
											So, look no further than the sand volleyball court behind ATO. The sand is absorbent and the courts are vacant about five months out of the year (shoutout to the decidedly anti-beach volleyball weather of Philadelphia). Most importantly, the court's location-hidden in the shadowy depths of Locust Walk-provide you with easy access, while the surrounding shrubbery and architecture add a surprising amount of privacy. It's like the drunken version of The Secret Garden.
											<br>
											As an added bonus, the sand provides extra padding for you and your hair-holding companion to kneel comfortably.
											<br>
											There's only one downside: The windows of Hillel put you on full display. Swallow your pride and let everything else come up while rabbis watch you vomit to your heart's content.

											<p>Since tobacco barons Mr. and Mrs. Eisenlohr turned over 3812 Walnut to dear old Pennsylvania in 1939, this chateau revivalist mansion has probably seen less shut-eye than celebrated architect Horace Trumbauer initially designed it for. Originally passed on to the Graduate School of Education, it was only in 1981 that this West Philadelphia masterpiece came to be the much neglected President's House.
											<br>
											While Amy G personally may prefer to keep her hubby company in New York, we at Street hear that our friends from SLAP and SOUL got her covered. Despite the availability of unused rooms, recliners and garden benches (the cherry blossoms are beautiful), our activist brethren set up shop on the floor with some coordinated sleep-shouting. <i>(Ed. note: Italian marble may not be the comfiest place to violently dream up Penn's PILOT contributions, though the 24 newly-empty Philly public schools make a viable alternative.)</i> Not to be outdone, our President's empathetic response was probably the closest thing she's gotten to a good old nap in a 90 mile radius. A top tip for the next soir&eacute;e-crashers: sweet nightmares-die-in's are out, and lie-in's are, well, in.

											<p>There's nothing more adventurous than blurring the line between life and death. If you're ready to live on the edge, leave the Penn bubble and walk a few blocks to the Woodlands Cemetery at 40th street and Baltimore avenue. The multipurpose ground is a West Philly gem. The mile-long loop around the edge of the cemetery is the perfect path for runners and walkers (including the walking dead). Also, many Philadelphians picnic at the Victorian era grounds. The Hamilton Mansion, located in the cemetery's center, can be rented out for private events. You can also do drugs here.
											<br>
											Or maybe, make this your formal destination? The Woodlands Cemetery also holds events throughout the year, such as the upcoming GO WEST! Craft Festival this Saturday, April 25th, from 11am to 5pm. The festival highlights local art vendors, food, music and performers-including circus aerialists. This spooky cemetery is so hot right now that people are dying to get in.

											<p>Women, am I right? Always crying about this or that, probably because of the patriarchy. In any case, Fergie was wrong when she said big girls don't cry. Sometimes you just have to let it all out, and there's no better place than the Women's Center. Seriously, the Women's Center has an amazing, supportive staff, a community of extremely caring people (not just women), the cutest dog you'll ever see, couches and free tea. It's not only the best spot to cry, but really, it's the best spot to do anything.  They can help you get through any crisis, no matter how big or small, and for that we thank them. It might be called the Women's Center, but the place is perfect for fellas and non-cis people too.

										<p>Mom's made her way to campus to see her little smoochykins. <i>(Ed. note: Yes, you should be embarrassed she still calls you that.)</i> You've gone through the routine: shown off your freshly cleaned room, walked up and down Locust and had a late lunch at White Dog. Now it's time to bring out the big guns and show her how liberal artsy your Penn education has made you. The Barnes Foundation is just a short ride from campus and an oasis of its own. Step onto the smooth stone pathway and you'll be greeted by lush greenery, reflective ponds and soothing fountains. Perfect to relax that nervous mother of yours after any concerns raised at White Dog. The Barnes Foundation crafted this quirky museum with the crucial understanding that people hate to read. Enjoy his vision. No more labels and tedious texts to bog you down, just take in the creative assembly of art. The galleries are intimate and the arrangement of the art is visually stimulating. The dynamic range of artistic styles gives the exhibits definition and depth. Bonus: the small size of the Barnes means you don't even have to schlep mom around too much. She'll be captivated for hours and there's plenty of places for you to sit while trying to come up with an Insta caption that'll make you seem cultured as fuck.
