			<h1>Introducing the Penn Ten</h1>
			<p align="center">Over the course of this semester, The Daily Pennsylvanian has worked to find the most impressive undergraduates at Penn. We asked the Penn community to nominate those who are making an impact at Penn, in Philadelphia or around the world - and who will continue to do so post-graduation. We sent out applications to the top nominees, which were reviewed by a selected panel of alumni judges. The inaugural Penn Ten is a diverse cross-section of the Penn undergraduate population. These students are working tirelessly to empower those who are disadvantaged, to develop innovative technologies that solve serious problems and to make the world healthier and happier - all while balancing the many responsibilities of life at Penn. Over the course of this week, the DP will take you from an impoverished village in Ghana to the Long Island suburbs to hear their stories. We are confident that all the winners will accomplish great things and hope you find inspiration in their experiences and passions. The DP is proud to present the first ever edition of The Penn Ten!

				Alumni Judges:

				Randall Lane, Editor, Forbes Magazine, C'90
				<br>
				Stephanie Weiner, Venture Capitalist, Bain Capital Ventures, W'14 GEN'15
				<br>
				Malcolm Evans, Founder, Evans and Company, W'11
