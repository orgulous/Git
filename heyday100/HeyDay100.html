		<div>ORIGINS AND GROWING PAINS
The cheerful parade-and-picnic arrangement currently constituting Hey Day has unexpected beginnings. According to Penn archivist Mark Lloyd, the celebration was born from a Penn tradition called the Bowl Fight.
A yearly ritual since the Civil War, the Bowl Fight was a rambunctious mass wrestling match between Penn’s freshman and sophomore classes. The sophomores would provide a bowl inscribed with their graduation year, and the freshmen nominated a so-called “bowl man.”

10:00 am: Hey Day Picnic Begins
11:30 am: Junior Cane March</div>
		<div>By Dia Sotiropoulu</div>
		<div>In 1940, Hey Day nearly died.
Student apathy was threatening to abort the tradition, inaugurated in 1916 as a “Moving-Up Day” to honor the advancement of Penn juniors to their next year. The occasion was later baptized “Hey Day” to give it a unique Penn signature. In a fashion similarly characteristic of Penn, 1940s seniors filled out that year’s Hey Day improvement questionnaire with joking answers. The Office on Student Affairs voted to abolish the celebration, and it was only narrowly saved in May 1940 by a student petition.
Leap ahead to 2014, and the tradition is hardly feeble — photos from that spring show an ocean of exuberant juniors trooping messily down Locust Walk, dressed in flaming red t-shirts and fake straw hats.
Indeed, Hey Day has evolved and reconstituted itself in tandem with Penn, reflecting each of its generations.
Since its founding, the custom has witnessed a world war and the University’s 1976 co-ed integration; it has been jeopardized twice, first by the reluctant seniors of 1940 and then by a perhaps overenthusiastic group of students in 1990 — they poured beer on then-President Sheldon Hackney and carried him out of College Hall on their shoulders, dropping him on the steps. It has absorbed a number of different Penn traditions while eliding others.
On this year, the 100th time Hey Day will be celebrated, it’s worth taking a look back at the tradition’s colorful journey to its present incarnation.

		<div>The freshman class’ objective was to break the bowl; the sophomore class’ was to put the bowl man into the bowl. In 1916, freshman William Lifson was killed in the fight, leading to the abandonment of the controversial custom. “Hey Day,” Lloyd explained, “was to take the place of the Bowl Fight.”
In 1916, therefore, the inaugural Hey Day was held, a somewhat tamer occasion involving an enormous congregation of all the undergraduates and the distribution of four senior honors awards known as the Spoon, Bowl, Cane and Spade awards. Then-Penn President Edgar Fahs Smith gave a short speech, which was followed by athletic events including a senior-junior track meet and soccer match.
Bouts of wrestling, boxing and tug-of-war at Franklin Field punctuated the evening, as well as the Sophomore Cremation, another tradition in which sophomores burned effigies of their most detested professors. Freshmen provided a finishing twist by throwing their black caps on the smoldering residues.
The parade component that is Hey Day’s signature today was added in 1938, causing The Daily Pennsylvanian to declare with satisfaction that Hey Day was "the most interesting class ceremony because it does not pertain to boring speeches." All four years participated in a spirited march to the Junior Balcony in the Upper Quad, with the president of each holding a class flag aloft.
A second trademark of the celebration fell into place when the so-called Junior Cane March, discontinued in 1959, was revived and added to the Hey Day program in 1965. Junior men dressed in jackets, ties and skimmers marched with cane in hand from McClelland Hall to College Hall before the official ceremonies began.
According to 1966 College graduate Cary Schwartz, however, Hey Day was still far from its current configuration at the time. To start with, Schwartz explained, campus geography in the '60s did not accommodate a grand march. “Locust [Walk] didn’t exist at that point,” he said. “The street was a pedestrian walkway to 34th Street — there were cars parked, and people drove from 37th to 40th.”
Moreover, Schwartz said, national events that year cast a foreboding shadow over the campus. “It was the brink of a tumultuous period,” he said of the beginning of the Vietnam draft. “You could sense it because all of the members of our class either went to grad school or were subject to the draft. Nearly everybody was taking physicals and seeking deferrals.”
Schwartz associates his own Hey Day mainly with its ceremonial components — initiation into the men’s honor societies, Sphinx and Friars, as well as distribution of the men’s awards.
The real end-of-year student celebration happened, he explained, at the so-called Skimmer Weekend, when undergraduates would go down to the side of the Schuykill River to watch crew team races.
Penn students’ timeless resistance to official supervision was on full display at these events. “There was no campus police at that point and the Philadelphia police were not amenable to students having a good time,” Schwartz said. “At that point, excess drinking and partying was sometimes met with hostility.”
It was in the '70s that the straw hats took on their cheaper styrofoam form. They began receiving the traditional “bites” to the brim in the '80s, when the bright red t-shirt was introduced into the Hey Day getup.
The history of female students' involvement in Hey Day is equally complex. It was in the '80s as well that Penn’s undergraduate women, still in a single-sex college of their own, were permitted for the first time to celebrate Hey Day alongside the male student body.
Back in 1926, Penn’s then all-male student body refused to allow their counterparts in the College of Women to partake in the Hey Day festivities alongside them, so the women — as they had done with many other student institutions from which they were barred, including The Daily Pennsylvanian and the activities planning committee — created their own equivalent.
The first women’s Hey Day was celebrated that year. A quartet of honors awards were meant to correspond to the awards given to the men, named after Penn pioneers Althea K. Hottel, Gaylord P. Harnwell, David R. Goddard and R. Jean Brownlee. It would be another 40 years after that before Penn women were allowed to participate in Hey Day with male students.
College of Women 1969 graduate Mary Cianfrani Miller remembers when the men’s and women’s Hey Day ceremony components were first held jointly in 1968. Treasurer of her class in her senior year and alumni president for the Class of 1969, Cianfrani said that integration was already in the air that year, though still a ways off — the College of Women wasn’t integrated into the University properly until 1976.
“We didn’t march with the men," she said. "We were invited to Irvine Auditorium for the ceremony.”

		<div>1965: The Junior Cane March Becomes Part of Hey Day Parade
The Junior Cane March, a Penn tradition that was part of Junior Weekend until 1959, was reinstituted as a key feature of Hey Day. The march was previously held on the day of the Penn-Navy football game sometime in late November as part of the annual Junior Week activities. In the past, the march marked the conclusion of Junior Week and preceded the all-University Chapel Service, the poster display, the football game, and the Junior Prom.</div>
		<div>The Red T-shirt
Introduced in the 1980’s as a nod to contemporary student fashions. The Styrofoam version of the skimmer hat was introduced at the same time.</div>
		<div>1990</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>1968: Men's and Women's Hey Days Combined
Men's and Women's Hey Day ceremonies were combined into a single celebration for the first time.</div>
		<div>1967</div>
		<div>The Spoon
The oldest of the men’s awards presented during Hey Day, dating back to the mid-1800s. Originally presented as a spoof award by a group of sophomores to the lowest freshman in the third-tier honors group, the first Spoon was engraved with a sarcastic caption in Latin. Four years later, the Spoon was presented to the most popular member of the senior class, known thereafter as the “Spoon Man.”</div>
		<div>1916: The First Hey Day
Hey Day began with the inauguration of a "Moving-Up Day", modeled after a similar custom already established at Syracuse University. The name "Hey Day" was agreed on by a committee a few weeks later.</div>
		<div>1990: Rowdiness Threatens the Hey Day Celebration
During the 1990 Hey Day, a group of students poured beer over President Hackney, carried him out of his College Hall office on their shoulders and dropped him coming down the steps. The prank put the following year's celebration in jeopardy, but student-led changes in the celebration kept it alive.</div>
		<div>The Bowl
The second-oldest of the men’s awards presented at Hey Day, instituted in 1882. Originally a component of the rather gruesome Bowl Fight, in which the freshman and sophomore classes would wrestle with a large bowl. The sophomores’ aim was to place a freshman, the designated “Bowl Man,” into the bowl; the freshmen’s was to break the bowl. The tradition ended in 1916 with the death of freshman William Lifson, but the Bowl was retained as an honors award.</div>
		<div>1939</div>
		<div>1926: The First Women's Hey Day
Women's Hey Day was first celebrated, six years after the passing of the Nineteenth Amendment, which gave women the right to vote.</div>
		<div>2015: 100th Hey Day
</div>
		<div>1976</div>
		<div>Althea K. Hottel Award
Named in honor of a pioneer in women’s education who earned three Penn degrees (B.S. in Educ., 1929; M.A. in Sociology, 1934; and Ph.D. in Sociology, 1940), Althea Hottel served as the Dean of Women from 1943 to 1959.</div>
		<div>The Cane
Originally the signature accessory of the Junior Cane March, a Penn custom born in 1918 and held every November for the junior class. It involved a march from the Quad to Houston Hall, during which each junior man toted a cane of solid mahogany with a customizable silver band. The March was discontinued in 1959, then revived as part of the Hey Day celebration in 1965; in the '80s, canes were issued in a cheaper, more flexible bamboo version.</div>
		<div>1916</div>
		<div>1999</div>
		<div>1937: The Parade of all Classes
The first time juniors, sophomores and freshmen were allowed to participate in the Hey Day celebration.</div>
		<div>Jean Brownlee Award
A woman's honor award first presented at 1977's Hey Day. Brownless was Dean of the College for Women from 1958 to 1975, and earned three degrees at Penn (B.S. in Education, 1934; M.A., in Political Science, 1936; Ph.D. in Political Science, 1942). She received an honorary Doctor of Laws in 1986, and was known for championing women’s causes long before they entered the mainstream.</div>
		<div>The Hat
The straw skimmer, the grandfather of Hey Day’s round-brimmed Styrofoam hat, was part of the Junior Cane March uniform. Before the arrival of Hey Day, the main springtime celebration for Penn undergrads was a day known as Straw Hat Day. Held on the second Saturday of each May to coincide with a baseball game against Princeton, Straw Hat Day was meant as an opportunity for students to abandon the tailored suits and formal felt hats usually worn to baseball games. It was such a well-known holiday that no one in the city of Philadelphia would wear a straw hat before Straw Hat Day arrived.</div>

		<div>HITTING 100
Fast-forward to 2015, and junior class president Jesus Perez has plans to leave his class’ own mark on the tradition. This year’s celebration on April 30 is being giddily billed as the 100th Hey Day, with all the trappings of a proper anniversary in the works.
“It's so crazy that the past three years have gone by so fast. Freshman year, I didn't know what Hey Day was, and now, I'm picking up my shirt tomorrow,” College junior Dan Kurland said.
Perez has made a number of changes he hopes will further refresh and strengthen the tradition. The intention, of course, is to “stay true to a 100-year-old tradition,” he said. “We’re going to have a picnic and a huge parade down Locust,” he enthused, and “decorate, line the trees down Locust Walk. It’s going to be beautiful.”
However he added that, “we wanted to modernize it, make it more special.”
Vice President for Public Safety Maureen Rush, however, intends to keep the peace as meticulously as on previous years. Students are known to get fairly reckless on Hey Day, she said.
“People will enjoy libations but they must do it safely,” she said. “I believe this Hey Day is a milestone, 100 years. It’s even more important that it be a really, successful, safe event for the legacy of the senior class and the junior class.”
“We’ll have police security, undercover officers, and the LCE will probably join us for the pre-events,” she affirmed.
Perez has held up his end, having made participation in the festivities cheaper and more accessible than ever before. Each junior’s “all-inclusive bundle” was subsidized, reducing it from $35 to $20 — a 43 percent drop, something that has never happened before, he said. Sales were also conducted online, making acquiring a bundle far more convenient.
The result has been a higher number of bundles sold than ever before — 2100 so far, as compared to the approximately 1600 of previous years.
This was accomplished through “phenomenal” sales of the signature junior class sweater, whose bright red “P” has since saturated campus.
“$35 is kind of hefty,” Perez said of the traditional fee. Students in the past have often had to seek financial help to cover the cost.
“In previous years the number of complaints that we heard were just overwhelming,” Perez said. “We virtually had no one [this time] reach out saying they had difficulty. That’s what I’m happiest about.”
Perez emphasized that the quality of the event would not be diminished at all. Costs have been strategically cut by diversifying the food options at the picnic while reducing the net volume of wasted food.
Additionally, the cane forming an essential part of the junior-class uniform will be reintroduced in its cheaper bamboo version, a throwback, Perez said, to the 80's and 90's.
Finally, a still-in-the-works “after-party” will be introduced, Perez continued, in which restaurants around campus will provide special discounts to juniors. Smokes and Copacabana are two restaurants currently being courted.
“We want everyone to continue hanging out with their friends since it is a very special day,” he said. “All of Penn should be celebrating.”
