    In the mid- to late 1900s, Penn demolished part of West Philadelphia to make way for its vision of an expanded campus. The University displaced residents and bulldozed homes with little regard for the community, which sparked protests from both students and residents. On top of the rubble, hundreds of buildings were constructed to form much of present-day University City.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now when Penn begins a construction project, in a stark contrast from the past,  it looks to the community before taking action &#150 holding community meetings and considering the benefits the building can have on the city. In 2003, Penn was encouraged by community members to purchase the mansion at 40th and Pine Streets. In developing the recently-celebrated South Bank property, Penn looked at how redeveloping the former industrial site would contribute to the public good of the city as a whole.
  </p>

   
  <p>
    While University City is booming today, the means Penn used to achieve this end has permanently stained its relationship with West Philadelphia. But through community partnerships and a collaborative development process, the University now actively works to move forward from the past.
    <p>
    &#147Lived experiences matter, and people don&#39t forget,&#148 explained Netter Center for Community Partnerships  Director Ira Harkavy. &#147Doing difficult things takes time, but there been an absolutely clear move from tension to collaboration.&#148
    </p>


  </p>
  <h3> Developing tension </h3>

  <p>
    In the first half of the 20th century, College Hall was surrounded by a congested mix of noisy cars, trolley lines and pedestrians on unattractive concrete sidewalks. But between 1953 and 1970, Penn eliminated the transportation lines and existing properties to make way for 93 new buildings, including the high-rise dorms and Van Pelt Library.

  <p>
Coinciding with the post-World War II &#147urban renewal&#148 movement, Penn&#39s vision moved swiftly into reality as federal and city policies funded institutional growth that was expected to revitalize urban areas. In 1962, the Philadelphia City Planning Commission designated 80 blocks around Penn&#39s central campus for redevelopment, which let Penn seize properties for its own construction goals. Throughout the 1960&#39s, local businesses and about 650 homes were displaced as the buildings on what is today Locust Walk were demolished.  </p>  
  <p>
   The property seizures in this redevelopment area &#150 where Hill College House, the Inn at Penn and administration buildings sit today &#150 displaced mostly white residents and business owners who were compensated by Penn and the city. While some Walnut Street property owners threatened to challenge the displacement in court, Penn negotiated deals to limit criticism.

    <p>
    After a relatively successful expansion period, Penn continued to develop northwest into the &#147Black Bottom,&#148 a predominantly black neighborhood. It was during this period that tensions between the University and the community erupted.

  </p>
  
  <p> &#147Penn&#39s development had gone relatively well from 1950 through about 1966, so Penn wasn&#39t apprehensive when continuing to expand north,&#148 University Archives and Records Center Director Mark Lloyd said. &#147But African Americans in that area protested since they did not see the interests of the University as greater than their own. The mood of the city changed.&#148
  </p>
  <p> Though &#147Black Bottom&#148 was located outside of Penn&#39s legal claim, the University worked through the West Philadelphia Corporation &#150 a Penn-organized coalition of education and medical institutions &#150 to further buffer its campus with education-oriented buildings, such as the University City Science Center.
  </p>

      </tr>
    </table>
    
  
  <p> From 1960 to 1970, the population in the redevelopment area north of Market Street fell from 4,603 to 654 people, according to U.S. Census Data. The Black Bottom Association, a community group of black residents and business owners, protested against the urban renewal projects that Penn largely spearheaded.
  </p>

  <p> &#147Because we were so connected to the community, we united to support each other,&#148 said Penn lecturer Walter Palmer, who helped organize his friends from Civil Rights Activist groups to fight against Penn&#39s expansion in the 1960s. 
  </p>
  
  <p> &#147Even though poorer black residents had real support in the neighborhood, we needed more than just people power,&#148 Palmer said. &#147You need money to maintain those fights.&#148
  </p>


  <p> 
    In 1969, Penn students took over College Hall in a nonviolent protest against the University&#39s displacement of African American residents. Harkavy, an undergraduate at the time, led the school in calling out Penn&#39s role in the destruction of West Philadelphia communities.
  </p>
<p>  &#147It was making a statement that Penn shouldn&#39t defer the community&#39s interests for their own,&#148 Harkavy said. &#147It was a turn toward the idea that Penn had a responsibility to its neighbors.&#148</p>
<p>
The University &#147failed to realize that a city is more than a series of buildings; it is made of neighborhoods,&#148 said Richard Rogers, a black West Philadelphia resident and Penn undergraduate at the time who joined in the protests.
</p>

<p>After 1970, Penn stopped building beyond 40th Street not only due to protests, but also because federal funding had dried up in a slowed national economy. Though westward expansion stopped, Penn&#39s tensions with the community still lingered.</p>

<h3> Establishing a Norm of Collaboration</h3>

<p>It wasn&#39t until the late 1980s that Penn really started to engage with the community. The University&#39s transition from one-sided development to active collaboration solidified when the Netter Center &#150 originally the Center for Community Partnerships &#150 was established in 1992.</p>

<p>&#147There was a history that Penn had to deal with,&#148 Harkavy said. &#147We emphasized that we must treat community members as ends in themselves, not as means to the end.&#148
</p>
<p>While Penn became more invested in general community affairs, such as access to nutritional food and quality of education, its approach to development also evolved. To include the community in its projects, Penn started working directly with neighborhood associations and holding monthly community meetings known as &#147First Thursdays&#148 &#150 venues that continue to be Penn&#39s main forum for informing community members about upcoming projects.
</p>
<p>&#147From taking and clearing land in the 1950s to the community initiatives of the 1990s, we now always try to build in conjunction with the community to support the community,&#148 Penn&#39s Director of Real Estate Services Ed Datz said.
</p>
<p>Even when community members oppose Penn&#39s plans and make it more difficult to build, the University has maintained its commitment to involving the community in projects &#150 most evident in its efforts to build graduate housing at 40th and Pine streets.
</p>

  </div> 
<p>Over a decade ago, Penn bought a mansion at 40th and Pine streets, a historic property that has yet to be built into anything of value for the University, after being encouraged to do so by local community members. After other community members rejected Penn&#39s redevelopment proposals, Penn finally received permission to demolish the property when it claimed financial hardship &#150 that the property could not be used for a valuable purpose. The Woodland Terrace Homeowners Association, a group of residents nearby the property, is appealing the demolition in two legal challenges against Penn. (One pertains to zoning violations and the other challenges demolition rights.)
</p>
<p>&#147Penn has done many things beneficial for the community, but on the other hand, we have this tension between the University&#39s desire to expand and the neighborhood&#39s desire to preserve our residential area,&#148 said Peter Manoogian, board member of the Woodland Terrace Homeowners Association. &#147We are concerned that this demolition may constitute a precedent for the University&#39s continued expansion further beyond 40th Street.&#148
</p>
<p>Another underlying cause &#147was certainly the sense that Penn could throw its weight around with everyone just having to go along with it," said Professor of Landscape Architecture and Historic Preservation Aaron Wunsch, who lived in the Woodland Terrace area. &#147There were also people involved in this who were part of the 'Black Bottom' story, and those memories have not faded.&#148
</p>
<p>Since Penn has responded to the community with several adapted proposals, Wunsch &#150 once part of the opposition &#150 now urges the opposing group to start negotiating with the University. Even though the Woodland Terrace Association is the only community group still opposing Penn&#39s plan, the University &#147has maintained dialogue with them over the years and along the way has not unilaterally taken steps to redevelop the site,&#148 Datz said.

          Like in the case of the mansion at 40th and Pine streets, West Philadelphia community members encouraged Penn to purchase the land where <b>Penn Alexander</b> currently sits. At the time, Penn didn't know that a school would take it's place.</div></td>
      </tr>
    </table>

<p>Just as community members encouraged Penn to purchase the mansion at 40th and Pine, the neighborhood wanted the University to take on the land where the Penn Alexander School sits today, &#147since it had the potential to have a tremendous impact on the neighborhood,&#148 said Barry Grossbach, executive director of the Spruce Hill Community Association zoning committee.
</p>

<p>&#147The development of Penn Alexander was done in partnership with the community,&#148 Datz said. &#147It was part of a pledge by Penn to make investments in the community at the request of the community.&#148
</p>
<p>Starting with President Sheldon Hackney&#39s administration in the 1980s, Penn focused not only on avoiding residential displacement and including community input, but also on &#147looking at opportunities to the east with the philosophy that the University should make our part of the city a better place,&#148 said Lloyd.
</p>
<p>Under Hackney, Penn started looking to buy the U.S. Postal Service parking land east of campus. Penn Park &#150 the 24 acres of redeveloped land &#150 now offers sports facilities and green space that better connect Penn to the rest of the city.

          <b>Penn Park</b> was developed in the space of a run-down, non-descript U.S. Postal Service parking lot, which Penn purchased during President Sheldon Hackney's tenure. It cost the University $46.5 million to develop Penn Park.</div></td>
      </tr>
    </table>

<p>&#147Penn Park is definitely a public good and a community feature since it benefits the University while also offering a public amenity,&#148 said Thomas Dalfo, senior vice president of real estate services at the Philadelphia Industrial Development Corporation, a public-private development organization that has worked with Penn.
</p>

<p>Penn is also helping the city in its most recent project on the South Bank &#150 a center for research and innovative enterprise. Built on an abandoned industrial site that was bringing down the area&#39s economic vitality, &#147the new commercialization center will be a very powerful tool that will more broadly benefit business development for the city as a whole,&#148 Dalfo said.
</p>
<p>Beyond furthering its own economic growth, Penn &#147realized too that development of this space would enhance the region,&#148 Datz said.
</p>

<h3> University City Today</h3>

<p>Penn&#39s long history of development has played a key role in making University City <a href="http://www.thedp.com/article/2014/10/report-highlights-university-city-as-a-neighborhood-on-the-rise">one of the most thriving neighborhoods</a> in Philadelphia.
</p>
<p>Beyond supporting economic growth, University City&#39s leading institutions have worked to integrate with West Philadelphia. In addition to Penn&#39s many outreach programs, University City District, which is largely funded by Penn, aims to improve the job opportunities, safety and overall living conditions of people living as far west as 50th Street.
</p>
  <div id="quote">
    "This generation of University leaders has learned very valuable lessons about community relations. This matters because as we grow, our goal is to be of the University City community."

    <div style = "font-size: 18px; color: #424242; margin-left: 8%"> -Craig Carnaroli, Executive Vice President of Penn</div>
  </div>
<p>But despite University City&#39s prosperity and growing partnerships, some believe the process to get here was too damaging to forget.
</p>
<p>&#147What the University did was egregious &#150 human beings were dispossessed &#150 and I don&#39t think this past can be fixed,&#148 Palmer said. &#147Many people think it will all go away, but there has to be truth before reconciliation.&#148
</p>
<p>Even with more community collaboration, Rogers thinks that University development has not changed radically since the 1960s.
</p>
<p>&#147To say [Penn and related institutions] do no good would be a lie, and I do believe in neighborhood improvement and acknowledge that change is inevitable,&#148 Rogers said. &#147However, it seems that some of the community meetings are just to placate folks and that people still don&#39t have complete control over what happens to them.&#148
</p>
<p>Despite irreversible damage to the community, most leaders involved in Penn-West Philadelphia partnerships see collaboration as an important step toward resolving the past.
</p>
<p>&#147Even after the history of encroachment on the community, we cannot deny the fact that Penn has become an anchor institution in the community,&#148 West Philadelphia Cultural Alliance President Frances Aulston said. &#147Years of process and progress show that the community and entire city have benefitted from the planning and economic development that has gone on here.&#148
</p>
<p id="end">&#147This generation of University leaders has learned very valuable lessons about community relations,&#148 Penn&#39s Executive Vice President Craig Carnaroli said. &#147This matters because as we grow, our goal is to be of the University City community.&#148
